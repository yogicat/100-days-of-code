## Day 1: 02-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
Studied `<form>` element and made simple signin page.Inspired by [Virgin America Airlines](https://www.virginamerica.com)


**Thoughts** 
I was having hard time understanding and using proper form element. I visited the W3c sites and went to so many websites just for looking for the  well- designed form. I can't say that I know all about the `form` but at least I am not afraid as I was before.

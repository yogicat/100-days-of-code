# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3

**Today's Progress**

**clone project** : clone subscription form from [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/)


**Thoughts** 
Getting to know the forms now.I used to think that the form is just a box with a text input on it and I was WRONG.There are so many types and attributes. I hope to make fully functioning form page one day.

I should try more SASS and JS from now on.

### Day 2

**Today's Progress**
**clone project** clone `<form>` element from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com)


**Thoughts** 
I had a very short amount of time to get today's work done, but since I've decided to commit I tried my best to get it done.
I was surprised by how focused I was.

## Day 1: 02-25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**
**clone project**  Studied `<form>` element and made simple signin page.Inspired by [Virgin America Airlines](https://www.virginamerica.com)


**Thoughts** 
I was having hard time understanding and using proper form element. I visited the W3c sites and went to so many websites just for looking for the  well- designed form. I can't say that I know all about the `form` but at least I am not afraid as I was before.
